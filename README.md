NUbots is a team in the University of Newcastle's robotics research group focused on developing humanoid soccer-playing robots for the international RoboCup competition.
The multidisciplinary team of students and academics develops both hardware and software for the robots.

This codebase is the current state of our development efforts to compete in the competition as well as active research projects within the laboratory.

# NUbots Documentation and Handbook
