# Director Soccer

This repository is a snapshot of the NUbots system with the Director implemented within NUClear. 

The Director extension for NUClear can be found at https://github.com/NUbots/DirectorSoccer/tree/main/module/extension/Director.
This includes over 30 automated tests at https://github.com/NUbots/DirectorSoccer/tree/main/module/extension/Director/tests.

The Director is presented in the following article https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09248.

Further documentation materials on using the Director in practice can be found at https://github.com/NUbots/DirectorSoccer/blob/main/DirectorDoc.pdf. This document explains the different DSL words and how they are used in C++ in NUClear. It serves as a guide and as a tangible way to understand the Director framework. It is derived from the [NUbook Director](https://nubook.nubots.net/system/foundations/director) page.
